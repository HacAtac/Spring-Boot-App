# Spring-Boot-App


## Description
 - This is mainly to get descent with Unit Tests on layers(Entity, Service, Controller) using Junit test
 - I've also switched from applications.properties to .yml as it's easier to read.
 - I've also learned about using actuator package to see details about app with endpoints
 - And also how to programatically create new actuator endpoint to expose certain endpoints like features of departments etc.
